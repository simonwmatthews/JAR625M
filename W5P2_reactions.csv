Reaction,Information
Olivine + Quartz → Orthopyroxene,"We do not often see Olivine and Quartz together in rocks, and where we do they are generally Fe rich. Maybe writing this reaction will help to explain why? You should use the Mg and Fe endmembers in the calculation (forsterite/enstatite & fayalite/ferrosilite)."
Muscovite + Quartz → Sillimanite + K-feldspar + H2O,Observations of thin sections of metamorphic rocks suggest this reaction is occuring. Under what conditions is it favourable? Does this affect the relative stabilities of kyanite and andalusite (try replacing sillimanite for them in the reaction).
Garnet + Olivine → Spinel + Enstaite,"In the upper mantle the mineral assemblage in peridotite contains either spinel or garnet, depending on the pressure it is at. By writing this reaction (using the Mg endmembers of the minerals- pyrope, forsterite, enstatite, spinel) identify the pressure this change occurs at. Why?"
Spinel + Orthopyroxene + Clinopyroxene → Plagioclase + Olivine,"In the upper mantle the mineral assemblage at shallow levels contains plagioclase as the aluminous phase. At higher pressures the Al is contained in spinel instead (and then garnet at even higher pressure). By writing this reaction (using the Mg endmembers of the minerals- enstatite, diopside, forsterite, spinel and the Ca endmember of plagioclase- anorthite) find the pressure this transformation takes place at. Why?"
Tremolite → Clinopyroxene + Orthopyroxene + Quartz + H2O,"Tremolite is one of the phases that carries water down into subduction zones. Magma is produced in the wedge due to the infilitration of H2O lost from the subducting slab. Under what conditions will tremolite break down to release H2O, and why?"
hydrogen gas + oxygen gas → H2O,"Mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen gas are highly explosive, why is this? Would they also be explosive at the pressures and temperatures of Earth's interior? If a gas giant has large amounts of hydrogen in its dense atmosphere, what would this suggest about the amount of oxygen?"
hematite → magnetite + oxygen gas,"At Earth's surface materials made of Fe metal tend to become oxidised (rust) over time due to reaction with oxygen gas in the atmosphere. Are there any conditions on Earth or other planets where hematite might break down to form oxygen gas? Hint, adding ""Tmax="" and a higher temperature will allow you to plot your diagram to much higher temperature conditions- ask me if you need help with this."
nepheline + quartz → albite,"Nepheline is seen only in rocks that are ""silica undersaturated"", which means nepheline and quartz are virtually never seen together. Could they form albite if they react? Why?"
kyanite → quartz + corundum,"When you see phase diagrams of Al2SiO5 it contains only the three polymorphs kyanite, sillimanite, and andalusite. But quartz and corundum are also in this chemical system. Would they ever be the stable assemblage. Replace kyanite for the other two polymorphs in the reaction. Why is this?"
quartz → tridymite,"Tridymite is a SiO2 polymorph. Under what conditions will quartz be replaced by tridymite? Hint, you might need to change the P and T scale of the diagram using Pmax=… and Tmax=… ."
quartz → coesite,"Coesite is a SiO2 polymorph. Under what conditions will quartz be replaced by coesite? Hint, you might need to change the P and T scale of the diagram using Pmax=… and Tmax=… ."
